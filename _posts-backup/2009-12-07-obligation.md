I was in the pool hall the other day, practicing on a table alone, and someone sat down near the table and was watching me.  Normally I wouldn't mind, and I guess to an extent I didn't mind, except that I was ready to leave.  Despite being tired and feeling as if I may be coming down with a cold, I strangely felt obligated to continue practicing in order to "entertain" this person, who I didn't know.

On this particular occasion I fought this urge to continue in order to entertain this individual longer, but at the same time began to wonder why I felt such a strong urge in the first place to continue doing so.  It is very strange, this sense of obligation, and even more so the things we do because of it.
