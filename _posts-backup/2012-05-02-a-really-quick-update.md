This is just a really quick update for you. I've been busy.

Not an excuse, right? Well, I've really been burning myself out at work. So much so that when I sit down to work on something for UnRegister while at home my mind goes directly to my employer related projects. All that basically means that I haven't made any progress at all, but hope to carve out some time this weekend to finally pick things back up.

In other news, I gave the blog a quick face lift. I was able to get WordPress running locally  and quite easily I might add so hopefully I'll put together a post on that in the next few days. Once I had my data imported locally I really liked the font face and things from the default WordPress theme so I've switched over to that from the free PageLines version. I've slapped a background image that I grabbed from [Background Labs](http://www.backgroundlabs.com/) so frame things in a little better, and what you see is what I did.
