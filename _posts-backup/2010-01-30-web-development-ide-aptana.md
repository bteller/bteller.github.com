Last night I was looking once again into why I had abandoned my efforts to learn Ruby on Rails and began picking up the materials again. When I had been looking into it before, I had downloaded a few development tools to use, one of those being RadRails from Aptana. At the same time I've been making some modifications to my existing website which is presently just a small collection of html pages, so I thought I would try using Aptana for that rather than Visual Studio or just a simple text editor, and as it turns out, so far I am really enjoying it.

If you haven't already checked out Aptana's IDE, it is worth a look.
