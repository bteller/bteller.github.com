Once again I find myself not missing Facebook. I haven't signed into the system for a few days now I think, other than just a moment ago to see what I was missing, and I still just don't get it. For starters I guess I have a problem with the fact that the system never seems to function as I would expect. Status updates posted by my friends fail to display in the summary view for me, and the live feed just contains far too much crap for me to find it useful. Does anyone really care to know when their Facebook friends have friended other people?

In the beginning I was a little confused about Twitter. Now though I'm thinking I find that to be a much more useful service than Facebook. Yes, it is nice that people you haven't heard from in years can find you, but to that I ask why it was that you went years without speaking to these people in the first place?

I think I'll keep my account active, for now anyway. But I'm going to turn off the connection on my phone so I will no longer be receiving updates there. Now we'll really see how long I can go without accessing the service and really find out if it is useful.
