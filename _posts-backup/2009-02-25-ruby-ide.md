One of the shortcomings of working with Ruby on a Windows machine seems to be the lack of a good editor or IDE to work in. I have tried everything from Notepad to the standard edit command, and what I have found the most useful is NetBeans. What I did was install the application, add the directory to the executable into my Path environment variable, and now I run commands like 'netbeans database.yml' and up comes the IDE.

For anybody else that decides to try this, just make sure you don't close NetBeans after every file you edit. The application itself takes some time to open, so it ends up being a real pain in the neck to use if you are constantly waiting for it to open.
