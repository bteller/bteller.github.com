About a year ago I picked up two books from Amazon.com, "The Ruby Programming Language" from O'Reilly, and "The Rails Way" from Addison Wesley. It was my intention, since I was no longer writing any code at all at work, to learn a new programming language, something that took me away from the Microsoft .Net framework, and into a wonderful new world of possibility.

Well, twelve months later those books are sitting on a book shelf collecting dust. My understanding of the Ruby language is limited, and my skills as a Rails developer are severely lacking. It seems that Microsoft has me trying to approach development their way. Lost to me is my integrated development environment with all the tools I could possibly need right at my fingertips. I've yet to come across a Ruby IDE that offers me the same power as Visual Studio does for .Net, which has made my adoption of the Ruby language, and my learning it, a little less fun than I had initially hoped.

I'm back though, sort of. Amidst the classes I am taking, and another development effort built on the .Net framework which I am trying to breath life into, I plan to forge ahead, however slowly, on learning Ruby and trying to find out just how exactly to get it on Rails.

I hope that this post is the first in a series of posts with Ruby and Rails as the topic of conversation. My hope is that as I learn, others will learn as well. In the meantime I leave you with this, I have found that the quickest way to pick up anything at all about Ruby and Rails is to watch the screen casts that are sprinkled around the web. Just be careful that what you are watching, or reading for that matter, is targeting towards a 2.x release of the Ruby framework, because I found out the hard way, a lot has changed since the 1.x days. To be honest, these changes are what has made it so difficult for me to learn Ruby, since examples that I try to follow to build my own versions of blogs or other tools end up not working.
