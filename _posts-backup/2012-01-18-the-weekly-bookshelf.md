title: The Weekly Bookshelf

I am going to try something out which I'm calling "The Weekly Bookshelf". This is going to be a list of what I'm currently reading, or have read over the course of the past week. I'm only going to identify blog posts that really I found enjoyable or really resonated with me. Please feel free to comment away.

### Books I'm done with:

- "Witch and Wizard" by James Patterson - I had read "Don't Blink" which I really enjoyed, but this one wasn't quite as enjoyable. It was a really easy read, Amazon has its reading level listed as ages 10 and up if that tells you anything. Seeing that never deters me though, I devoured the Harry Potter books so I thought it was worth a shot. The jury is still out as to whether or not I'll read the other books in this series.
- Sorry to report that I haven't finished reading any technical books this past week.


### Books I'm reading now:

- "Programming Entity Framework, Second Edition" by Julie Lerman - I've only cherry picked a few sections to read but it looks like it'll be informative. This was recommended to me by a colleague, so I'm sure it will be well worth the time I spend with it.
- "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" by Stieg Larsson - I read this already, probably about 2 years ago now, but with the movie having been recently released I want to read it another time.

### Blog posts I enjoyed:
- [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx) - This was just a really great post, good points, and hopefully it inspires all who read it to post more to their blogs.
Then there are these two here that are going to cause me to do some digging around, and the reason I decided I'd finally read the Entity Framework book. Did somebody kill off the repository pattern and forget to tell the rest of us?
