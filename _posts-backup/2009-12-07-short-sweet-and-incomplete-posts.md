I've been trying to figure out why exactly I avoid posting as much as I would like, and I have identified, for the moment, what I believe is a contributing factor.  Most of the time I have what I think is an interesting topic to discuss, but lack the time or desire to put any real effort into it.  Once I figured this out, I of course asked myself why that might be.

Well, I didn't come up with an answer exactly, only the decision to alter my mindset when it comes to posting.  From this point forward, if I have something to post, I'm going to post it, regardless of how incomplete that post might be.  At times I may go back and elaborate on past posts, but for the most part I suspect I will leave them incomplete.

Whatever the case may be, consider yourselves forewarned...
