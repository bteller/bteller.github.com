I ran into somewhat of a problem the other day with trying to get a web service to respond with a JSON object. As it turns out the solution is quite simple, and outlined very well at [http://encosia.com/2008/06/05/3-mistakes-to-avoid-when-using-jquery-with-aspnet-ajax/](http://encosia.com/2008/06/05/3-mistakes-to-avoid-when-using-jquery-with-aspnet-ajax/). I would summarize it here, but the author has done a very good job of that already.
