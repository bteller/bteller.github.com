I want to post something about requirements management and how it has changed. I'd like to say something about how this seems to be done more through test cases, unit tests and automated UI tests than it is through managing the initial requirement.

At the same time I don't know if this is a good thing. It kind of flies in the face of the PM project I was going to work on.
