title: Transparency, or a Lack Thereof
---

TL;DR, stop keeping secrets, tell people how you feel, improve the world, improve yourself.

## What You Say?

Most anyone that knows me knows that I'm a straight shooter. I say what I mean, and mean what I say, so to speak. There isn't anything I will say about you behind your back that I won't say directly to you, and whenever possible I try and say these things to you before I say them about you. Honesty is most certainly the best policy, and it makes no sense not to tell people how you feel, even when it's hard to do.

## Why Doesn't Everyone Feel This Way

Really, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all knew where we stand with each other? At the very least we should know how those closest to us, family, colleagues and the like, feel about us. I don't want some random stranger coming up to me and telling me what an ass I am, or how much I suck at life, because they don't know the first thing about me. Those people that I *do* spend considerable time with though, I definitely want to know what they think about me. 

If people weren't so sensitive then maybe, just maybe, we could correct behaviors, improve as people, improve in our career, and make the world a better place. Quite possibly I'm in the small percentage of people out there that can take the criticism without getting all bent out of shape, I really don't know. I just can't help but wonder though.

## Not Everyone Gets a Trophy

If only we didn't all seem to feel this way. My boss has a [book](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/not-everyone-gets-a-trophy-bruce-tulgan/1112034818?ean=9780470256268) with this title on his desk. I haven't read it, so don't ask me what it says. I assume though that it makes the argument that people today seem to think they should be rewarded when they do something well, and forgiven when they mess something up... regardless of how badly. That's a terrible attitude/approach to life. You don't have to run around trying to make everyone cry, but you can share constructive criticism. If people could stop taking things as personal attacks, realize that others are sharing these things because they care, want them to get better or improve, or succeed in life, maybe they could become more receptive of the criticism, and more apt to return the favor.

## Disclaimer

I'm not saying this about anyone, or to anyone, this is just something I've felt for a very long time. I've never understood the lack complete lack of transparency we have with each other when it comes to how we feel about them. I'm often surprised when people react negatively to what I believe is constructive criticism. Maybe it's my delivery! I sure wish someone would let me know.
