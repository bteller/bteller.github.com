Hooray! A new toy. After almost a full year of hemming and hawing later, I bought a laptop tonight.

## What took me so long?

I've really been trying to justify the purchase, looking at different makes and models, and all the varying price points between them. Apple of course just released a new MacBook Pro which is sexy as hell with the retina display. Then I was considering the Lenovo ThinkPad W520 which features an Intel i7 processor and allows for up to 32GB of RAM. Those have really been the two front runners over the last week, and I had pretty much decided I would buy one of them. But like I said, I've been putting this off for a year.

Here is why:

- I've got a decent desktop.
- I don't travel, not really.
- I used to have a laptop and gave it up in favor of a higher powered desktop.
- Beefy desktops are cheaper than beefy laptops.
- So, if I buy one, I'm afraid I won't get much use out of it.
- I kind of want a Mac, but I don't do anything geared towards a Mac.
- I think I want to sell my desktop and go laptop only, but maybe not.
- And the list goes on...

## What I bought and why!

I looked at the Lenovo, damn near bought a Mac, and almost bought a Toshiba ultra-book. What did I end up with? It is a $400 Dell Inspiron. This isn't exactly a power house.

So how did I end up with it? If I have a desktop, and probably always will have a desktop, then why not buy a lower frills laptop and just remote desktop into it? That saves me money, keeps it so I'='m only really using the laptop as a convenience and not my full time machine, but still lets me buy a new toy. So, that's what I did, whether I end up liking it or not.

I've only had the thing about 2 hours now and I've already hit a bit of a snag. I'm running Windows Home Premium on my desktop which doesn't allow for remote connections into it, only out of it. What a rip man! In retrospect perhaps I should have did a better job looking into that first. In my defense I did ask a friend of mine who hasn't had a problem with it, and I do remote into my work machine, but I know my work machine is running Windows 7 Ultimate, and I guess my friends is as well. So, I have to find an alternative.

So far I quickly tried out TightVNC but it doesn't seem to allow screen resolution adjustments so I'd have to be scrolling all over. Since I was thinking I would be able to run Visual Studio on the desktop through that connection, that just will not work. I tried Live Mesh and their remote control option, but they just scale the resolution to fit the screen, or allow for scrolling, which is a little better but not much. It looks like maybe UltraVNC might do what I'm looking for, so I'll give that a go. If that doesn't work then my only real options are to pay the restocking fee on this machine to BestBuy, or upgrade my desktop to Ultimate.

## Does it mean more blogging?

One of my hopes is now that I'm a bit more mobile, I might be encouraged to blog a little more. I enjoy learning and sharing what I learn, but having already spent my entire day in my chair at the office staring at computer screens, I really feel like a change of scenery when I get home. Maybe this way I'll be able to start watching a program on television and then allow myself to be distracted by the laptop, which is actually happening right now. I've installed Windows Live Writer on the laptop and I'm good to go.
