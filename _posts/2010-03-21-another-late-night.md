title: Another Late Night
---

Well, it has proven to be yet another late night. Now before this turns into another marathon evening of coding and other productive activities, I'm going to call it a night, but not without thanking the following post for finally allowing me to get my code blocks inside my blog posts and formatting as expected.

A sincere thank you to CraftyFella for [this post](http://www.craftyfella.com/2010/01/syntax-highlighting-with-blogger-engine.html).
