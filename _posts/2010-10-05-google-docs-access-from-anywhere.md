In the age of rich internet enabled applications, it is now more difficult than ever to separate work and personal life. The challenge comes with ease of access to these tools. Today (okay, for a while now), not only can we access our data from almost anywhere, we have access to tools with which to create and manipulate it as well. Enter tools from Google, and Google Docs in particular.

I've been using Google docs myself on and off for a few years now. To date that use has been sporadic at best, but beginning today I'm going to try and get to the point where all of my basic word processing and spreadsheet work will be done online with this tool. Already I'm delighted to see that the user interface has improved.

My primary reason for abandoning locally installed word processing applications is that while I might be able to carry this information with me on a thumb-drive, I'm not guaranteed I'll be able to open those files and edit them wherever I might be, and you know as well as I do, you never know when inspiration will strike you. I have a hard time throwing things away, and not in that sentimental attachment sort of way, I've just always been afraid that if I do, I'll find myself needing or wanting that thing back. In my life I have less of an attachment to the tangible like movies, CDs, and so forth, but what I hate losing more than anything is a thought or idea. Maybe one of these days Google will come up with a device capable of reading your mind, capturing all of your thoughts, then allow you to tag them and store them away to be searched against, accessed, and expanded upon later (I love that “penceive” thing from Harry Potter and want one badly). For now though I think Google Docs is the next best thing. If an idea hits me while I'm at work, I can fire up Google Chrome, head on over to Google Docs, slap together a new document with some quick notes and whatever else I might be able to incoherently articulate in 5 minutes or less, and save it off for expanding upon at a later date.

So there it is, stop losing your ideas, don't find yourself wishing you had copied off that old folder of documents to your thumb-drive before you headed out of town to visit the family only to find yourself having to break out the old pen and paper, not knowing exactly where you had left off before, and start making some serious use of these powerful internet tools we have available to us.

(2 minutes later)... Hey now! Where is the convert this document to blogger post option? Oh well, maybe they'll have that soon, because I didn't see it under the Share menu.
