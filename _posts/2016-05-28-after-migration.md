## Using Prose.io

The past few weeks I've been trying to decide what to do with my blog. The simplicity of blogging on Medium has been appealing, but I really want syntax highlighting for my code, which you can't do without gists, and even then you have no control over it. I briefly tried Ghost, setting up a droplet on Digital Ocean, but I didn't find that to be any better, and also thought about going back to Wordpress, heaven forbid. So what is a guy to do?

I had already came across prose.io as an editor for GitHub Pages, but I hated that it wanted access to all my repositories. There was also this nagging issue dealing with organizations, which I belong to, and Prose.io wanting access to those as well. That was going to be a deal breaker. Then, tonight, for whatever reason, inspiration hit me and I setup a new account on GitHub just for my blog. 

And... here we are. This is actually the first post I'm writing in Prose. I still have to find out how to edit post meta data, so this post will probably be checked in a few times. I guess we'll find out soon enough. 

Well, figured that part out before publishing. There is a Meta Data option in the right gutter menu. There you have it.
