I was just poking around a few things out there and came across an application called livingsocial, which seemed to be really cool and all, but I still don't care for how everything gets integrated, or coupled if you will, onto my profile page. Why can't I have a list of the books I'm currently reading alongside a list of songs that are going to carry me through the week, or websites I've found most useful in the past month?

The idea behind these applications, I thought, was to provide a medium for people to share information about their lives with others, or with everyone if they so choose. Unfortunately I still don't see any of them doing it right!!!

Does anyone want to hear my ideas?
