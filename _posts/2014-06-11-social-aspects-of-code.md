> Maybe we can drive higher quality through increased socialization at work.

Every now and then I'm asked what we might be able to do as a team to increase the quality of our code, and reduce the number of new bugs being introduced. Generally my answer has been that I don't know. If you think about it, this is really a psycological question... how do you make people care about what they are doing? And that, I'm not sure how to answer, because there isn't a single answer. It depends on the developer. While one developer might respond positively to increased pressure placed upon them by management, another might crumble. So now we have the first developer meeting their deadlines with a high level of quality because of the additional pressure, and another that may still meet their deadlines, but has done so by sacrificing quality. Clearly, applying additional pressure is not the right answer.

## Increased Socialization

What if, instead of management driving improvements to quality, it was our peers? One aspect of the agile process is paired programming. Is it possible that by having one of our peers looking over our shoulders as we work might give is additional incentive to produce a quality product? I think so. 

Take that a step further and think about the last thing you do before releasing a new feature... testing. What if during the testing a peer was also present. Wouldn't there presence again create additonal incentive for us to make sure our test cases are up to snuff, that they cover everything that needs covering, and that we run them? Again, I think so. 

Another side of this is getting away from your desk. Call it the pomodoro method, or whatever you want, but I feel it is important to walk away. One of the reasons quality suffers is that the developer gets bored with what they are working on. If they were to get away from their desks every 45 minutes for 10 minutes, I again think we would see an increase in quality and a reduction in bugs.
