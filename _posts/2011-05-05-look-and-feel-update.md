title: Look and feel update
---

Tonight, rather than work on Freedom, I was going to update the look and feel of my blog. Well, after about 10 minutes time spent trying to decide where to start and what to change it dawned on me, I don't have any traffic. For now, no traffic means no improvements. If people finally start finding something useful out there, then and only then will I try and spruce things up a bit.
