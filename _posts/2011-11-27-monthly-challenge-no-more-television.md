title: "Monthly Challenge: No More Television"
---

This is something I have been wanting and meaning to do for a long time now, and finally I think I'm just going to rip off that band-aid. I have unplugged my television and put it in a closet.

Over a year ago I cancelled my cable subscription from Time Warner and only left high speed internet access on my account. Instead of cable I subscribed to two services, Netflix (streaming only) and Hulu Plus. I'm honestly not sure but I believe both services are between $7.99 and $8.99 a month. That was a savings for me of about $40 per month over the cable subscription. Money wasn't the only thing I was looking to save on though. What I had wanted was to create more time for me to explore other interests. I wanted to:

- read more
- learn more
- perhaps get back to completing my degree
- exercise more

Overall, I wanted to strengthen my mind through the absence of television. Don't get me wrong, I do feel that some of their programming has merits. Not having the local news was a challenge, but I can always go online and find out what is going on in that arena. I really missed shows from Discovery, History and National Geographic, which was the primary reason for my Netflix subscription, they have many of their productions ready for streaming. If that was all I've been watching then perhaps I wouldn't be going through this exercise now, but that wasn't it. Hulu Plus allows me to watch many of the shows I enjoy, but what I've found is that instead of going to the gym after work I'll come home and spend the first 2 hours or so catching up on those shows, and then I never make it over to the gym. Television has basically become my excuse for not accomplishing the things I would like to; it is ceaseless distraction.

That changes now though. One of my goals is to find something every month that I can live without. Back 11 months ago that was my plan when I set my resolutions for this year, but I've been really lax in accomplishing any of those things. Hopefully that ends now though. I'm starting this monthly challenge a little early, quite frankly because I'm interested in the quality of life improvements that will arise from it, and I don't want any more time to go by in which I might come up with some excuse or justification for not following through with this. I know I probably won't be able to cut out television completely, they are all over the place, but I will eliminate television from my home.

Has anybody else done anything similar?
