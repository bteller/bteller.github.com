Well, it is about as official as it can get. I called the cable company up today to find out what I have to do to cancel my cable service, tv not the internet, and all I have to do is return the equipment, which I'll be doing tomorrow.

Why you might ask? I would respond to you with a question... what good is television anyway? Sure, you have the news, the weather, and in general the ability to keep current on current events, but how many of us spend the majority of our television watching time on channels with programs of any value. Personally my favorite channels are the History Channel and Discovery Channel, but even those stations have mindless programs on them. Let's be honest with ourselves now, how much educational value do you get out of an hour of Ice Road Truckers, or 30 minutes of Pawn Stars? None. Are they entertaining? Absolutely. I'm just tired of spending countless hours a week allowing my mind grow numb while sitting or laying in front of a glowing box with meaningless drivel flashing before me.

How on earth am I going to pass the time without television? I was thinking I might read a book. Growing up I'd venture a guess that I spent 30+ hours a week reading. Then I could always start keeping a journal, which is something I keep telling myself to do, but never managed to stick with. Then there is always exercise, visiting local parks, and tackling some of the projects I've left sitting on the back burner for years. And yes, on occassion I might rent a film, or even head out to a movie theater.

Life without television... I think it is possible.
