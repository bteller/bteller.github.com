title: The Weekly Bookshelf

I know I was going to try and put this out weekly, but I was a little busy, then simply not feeling very motivated to post to the blog. Hopefully I'm over all that now. Here is the most recent installment.

- [Programming Entity Framework, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Entity-Framework-ebook/dp/B0043D2DS2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1327544440&sr=8-2) by Julie Lerman - I found this book to be well written and informative. I read it, for the most part, cover to cover. I did gloss over certain areas of the book, scanning the text for good tidbits of information while leaving other areas covered by the text for later exploration if and when the time comes when I might require that particular knowledge. I did find some of the code examples to be lacking in their thorough coverage of real world implementation, but I very rarely come across code examples that I feel are truly comprehensive. This book covers everything from the basics of Entity Framework and concepts on up through advanced topics such as dealing with an entities connected state and how to manage that state within the context.
- [The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Professional-Programmers-ebook/dp/B0050JLC9Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1327544811&sr=1-1) by Robert C. Martin - Wow, this one was actually very entertaining. The use of dialog to drive home his points was excellent. This is a book I would recommend for anyone working in the IT industry, not just computer programmers. While some of the topics are geared more to developers, there is a lot to be gleaned from the text about how to be a "professional" within the IT field that anyone could benefit from. I will say that the man sure did like to repeat himself. How many times do we need to know where he  was working and what he did wrong? I'm grateful for the story sharing though, however repetitive it might have been in places, for the simple fact that it made me feel a little better about some of my own blunders. We all stumble along the way, it is the mark of a true "professional", and really just the mature adult, when you can learn from your mistakes and allow them to make you that much stronger in your field. Definitely well worth a read. Can I say 5 1/2 stars? But seriously, I'm considering purchasing this book because it is something I know I'll want to pick up and read again to get my head back in the game and regain my focus.
- [Professional ASP.Net Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-ASP-NET-Design-Patterns-ebook/dp/B0045JL68W/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1327545108&sr=1-1) by Scott Millett - I had started reading it a few months ago but never really got into it. The code samples are a little hard to follow in places but you can download the full code off of [www.wrox.com](http://www.wrox.com/). Other than that, anybody working a .Net shop interested in learning more about practical applications of design patters, this is a good place to start.

And, as always, here is a list of blog posts, and other assorted pages, that I enjoyed for one reason or another.

- [http://theoatmeal.com/horrible](http://theoatmeal.com/horrible) - Some of these are just down right hilarious.
- [http://zenhabits.net/spiral/](http://zenhabits.net/spiral/) - I read this a while ago but thought given this is the first month of a new year you might be interested.
