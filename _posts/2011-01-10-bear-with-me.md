I'm slowly updating the look and feel of my blog, so hang in there. From what I can tell there aren't any content problems I'm introducing, so anything you want to grab from here should still be accessible. I installed the Thematic Theme Framework plug-in and am using that to shape a new look. Hopefully at the end I'll have better control over things than I would using a packaged theme. I also switched to using the Sociable plug-in for sharing of posts, which looks much cleaner than what I had on here before (deleted it right away, so don't know what it was).

In the meantime, does anybody have any ideas for what I might improve? I'm searching for as minimalistic a design as possible, mostly because I'm not graphically inclined at all. I know what looks good on other peoples blogs, but to try and design something for myself from scratch, ain't happening! Keeping that in mind though, all suggestions are welcome. Some thought provoking questions include, should I have a subscribe link? If providing subscriptions, what service should I use, FeedBurner or other? Are there any plug-ins I can install that will help me with SEO optimization? Do you want to see a picture of me? Crap like that.
