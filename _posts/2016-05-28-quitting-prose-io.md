Okay, that lasted all of about 30 minutes. I really didn't care for the editor. It seemed like a great idea, but trying to rename a post was painful, so was creating a new post. I'm going to roll with command line for now. I installed the [jekyll-compose](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) gem, and will just use Visual Studio code for editing, and preview. It would be awesome if VS Code someday made it possible to edit *while* in preview mode.

Besides, I already nuked the other account.
