I was just looking at the statistics for my blog, and not surprisingly the traffic is very, very low. So, project number 1 for this weekend is to try and turn that around.

Personally I know I need to spend a little more time in putting together more comprehensive posts to make them more beneficial to my would-be readers. To date I've justified my very short and to the point posts, to myself, by telling myself that I as a blog reader really do not tend to read the contents of many posts in their entirety, especially not when they are of a technical nature. Instead, I seek out what I'm there looking for, skim the post at best, pull out what I need, and then move on. In retrospect, perhaps that's why my own blog is doing so poorly.

I've been spending the last hour or so looking around for suggestions on what I might be able to do differently, tools I can use, and looking for any other possible insights. At present I'm focusing my attention on Google Webmaster Tools, to see if that might be able to help in any way. At this same time I'm also trying to decide if Blogger is the best place to host my blog, or if I might fare better with another service, or hosting the blog on my own.

In the meantime, if you are out there, tell me you are there. If you find something I post helpful, say so. The same goes for posts that you don't like.

I look forward to seeing my traffic go up, and hearing from some of youâ€¦ any of you.
