Time truly is a valuable resource, and a rare commodity.

Over the past month or more my life has been a little crazy. Nothing terribly out of the ordinary, and nothing traumatic, but crazy nevertheless. Last weekend I spent somewhere around 30 hours in a pool hall in our local 8-ball cities tournament, hoping to get a team qualified for Las Vegas. That didn't happen, but it was exciting and I had a good time. The weekend before I was up in NY visiting family and playing a little bit of golf. It was enjoyable, for the most part, and I really needed the mental break.

Other than that I've just been very busy with work. When I get home, even when I do have time to spare, I find myself so drained that I can't get excited about or focus on much of anything, least of all blogging. So now what I really want to know is how other people out there seem to find the time to blog as regularly as they do? You've got the Rob Conery's, Scott Hanselman's and Jeff Atwood's of the world that definitely seem to find the time. Not only that, they find enough of it to put out quality posts, not merely a rant such as this where I'm complaining about not having enough of it. I think they have day jobs. Are they allowed, or perhaps even expected, to dedicate some of their time each day, or every week, to blogging?

All I really know is that my Google Reader account is constantly picking up new posts from all around the web, and I can't even get excited enough about writing a post to come up with a good topic. Is it writers blog? Is there even such an affliction for bloggers? Who knows.
