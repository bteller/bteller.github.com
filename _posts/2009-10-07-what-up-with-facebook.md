Okay, so I've been unable to access the service now for 3 days. I've sent an email to tech support and received no feedback in return. I've been checking every few hours now to see if my account problems have been corrected, but am met with disappointment every time. And now, all my problems have led me to question the usefulness of the service.

Why do I need it at all? Sure, I can find and connect with people I haven't seen in years. Then again, if they were that close to me in the first place, I think I might have managed to stay in touch with them on my own instead of being reminded of their existence through random friend requests.

What functionality does it provide? I can share a random thought, or tell people where I am. Doesn't anybody else view that as a security risk? Hey, I'm off to the beach for the weekend. Well, guess what, Brad isn't going to be home... wonder what he has in his place that I might want to get my hands on. Sure, you should have some security, not allowing people other than your friends to view your posts is an intelligent thing to do; but as I mentioned before, how well do you really know these people anyway? Do you trust that they won't pay an unwelcome visit while you are away? I'm not sure I do.

If you want my opinion, I'm tired of FaceBook. And while I'm on the subject, I don't see much use for Twitter either. For some these services make sense. They must considering the number of new users each get every day. For me though, I just don't see the value. If you want to get in touch with me, I'm on Google Talk. If you want to talk to me, I'm on Google Voice. And you know what, once I find out that Google Wave has officially launched, I'll be there as well, because at least I can see the value in an online collaboration service like that. These other services though, unless you are in the entertainment business, or otherwise have some driving need to let people know where you are, what you are doing, or what is on your mind, 24/7/265, why bother?
