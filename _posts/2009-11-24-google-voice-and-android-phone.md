title: Google Voice and Android Phone
---

So, I've been playing around with Google Voice for a while now, and I really like it.  It is great to only have to give people one number and have the flexibility of routing calls to that number to one or more device.  I also just recently picked up an Android based phone from T-Mobile, the Motorola Cliq.  On this phone I was able to install the Google Voice application for the Android OS, which I thought was going to be great, but I am having certain challenges.

Let me start by saying that the application installation was a breeze, and configuring the phone to prompt when making calls whether to use the Google Voice number or my T-Mobile number was simple and effective.  My problem at this point are as such:

- SMS routing through the Google Voice number only seems to be possible if you create the message through your contacts list and not directly through the global messaging application and selecting new text message.
- Replies to these SMS messages by the recipient come in from a strange number which makes it difficult to follow conversations in different threads for any given person.
- The Google Voice application itself when I try to compose a new message only seems to list those people who are in my Google address book, not all of the contacts stored in my phone.

I searched the web for some sort of help with these problems, but have come up empty.  Now I'm hoping someone stumbles upon this post and happens to be able to provide some insight into what I need to do in order to correct the problem, or perhaps point this out as a current shortcoming in the service.

Anybody???
