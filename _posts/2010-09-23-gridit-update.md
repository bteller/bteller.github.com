I finally spent some time this evening updating gridIt to include pagination support. I would have spent more time, but I had to learn how to remove a file from a root commit from a github repo, which proved a little more complicated than I thought it would be.

Regardless, the updated code can be found out [here](http://github.com/bteller/jquery).

Now, perhaps I'll be able to get some sleep. I have to be to work in a few hours.
