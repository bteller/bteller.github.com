A coworker of mine recently opened a local computer repair business. I know the guys on his team and personally recommend them if you live in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. Here's a blurb from his site:

> Our technicians have a combined 37 years of experience in computer repair. We grew up with computers, cutting our teeth on simple repairs and setups that are second nature now. Fixing computers is part of who we are, or at least that's what our relatives think, since each time we go for a family visit, someone asks, "Hey, can you take a look at my computer?"
