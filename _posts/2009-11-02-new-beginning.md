title: A New Beginning
---

This post was actually written last Thursday, and I'm only getting around to posting it today.  Kinda pathetic, huh?

I'm sitting at Tire King at the moment, waiting for four new tires to be put on my car, and I figured this would be as good a time as any to catch up on some of the posts I've been meaning to write.

This post is titled a new beginning, because that is what I feel I am starting at the moment.  My eight year career with my present employer is coming to an end, and with that end will hopefully come new opportunities.  During these eight years I have had the opportunity to work with some incredibly talented people who have taught me a great deal.  I have held positions ranging from IT Help Desk Operator to IT Systems Architect, with a few more years spent developing standalone as well as portal integrated web applications.

It is the development experience I am hoping to lean on to seek new employment.  While I was working as a developer 100% of the time, having done some development all along, I found my work was much more enjoyable.  While I might have learned things in other roles, the act of creating something from nothing is something I find to be very rewarding.

While I wait for new employment opportunities I am going to continue writing code, and hopefully earn a certification or two to add to my resume.  And who knows... perhaps I will end up writing an application that becomes my Facebook.  I have a few potential ideas that I have kept on the shelf for some time now, not having the time to dedicate to the development of them, but now that I find myself out of work I no longer have any excuses not to start.
