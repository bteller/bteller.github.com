I came across this the other day and wanted to share a link about it. This does two things, makes me feel good about sharing something I found on the web, and at the same time gives me a place to go back and look should I ever need to get back to this again. I'll put it out on delicious as well, but I still haven't managed to get out there and organize all my tags, so it is often a little challenging for me to find anything.
