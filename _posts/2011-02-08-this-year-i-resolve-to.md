Okay, so I guess I'll go ahead and try to commit to this. A few weeks ago I was thinking what I could do to make some improvements in my life. You know what I mean, that dreaded self reflection that happens to most of us at the beginning of every new year, and the list below is what I came up with. Initially I was thinking I'd tackle one item a month, but then I ran out of things to add to the list. So instead I'll be tackling as much as I can at one time.

1. Quit drinking
2. Quit smoking
3. No more eating of fast food
4. Begin an exercise regimine (a.k.a. get in shape)
5. Obtain technology certifications
6. Eliminate credit card debt
7. Ramp up retirement contributions
8. Enhanced strength of character (no more pride, envy, ...)
9. Improve relationships with family and friends
10. Read more technical materials (books, blogs and the like)
11. Blog weekly (this is a good start)
12. Start an open-source project (not sure that I'll get to this)

Okay, so there it is. Now let's see how I make out with all of it.
