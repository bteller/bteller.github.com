Corny title for a post, I know, but after about an hour of messing around with it, I was finally able to get the proper tooling installed on my Windows computer so I can make use of my Git account. I have 2 repositories out there, but only 1 with any content right now, which is the one named jquery. What I uploaded into jquery today was the start of some grid plugins, they build off each other, so check it out if you are interested. Once I put a little more work into them I'll put together a more comprehensive post about them.
