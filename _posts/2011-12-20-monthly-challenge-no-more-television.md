Yes, that's right, I wasn't able to stick with it. It is ridiculous how much I've come to rely on television to pass the time after work. I started back renting a few movies from Vudu, and then got tired of paying $4.99 or so a pop for those so re-activated my Hulu Plus subscription. I'm going to remain off of Netflix, and will hopefully be able to get the television back into the closet if not completely out of my house. For now though it is an evil I am not sure how to live without.

I'm really disappointed in myself. I'll get there though, it is just going to be more of a challenge than originally thought.
