It's snowing here in Raleigh, North Carolina. At this point there is only about two inches of snow, and the snow itself seems to be slowing down. Nevertheless I have already heard the first sirens of the night, and they are almost certainly not to be the last.

When I lived in New York snow was a common place occurrence, especially for this time of year, but here things are different. Here, even with the threat of inclement weather places begin to shut down. To me it is almost comical, but apparently they do not have, or do not have enough of, whatever the case might be, the proper equipment to deal with the snow. At this point I'm just hoping I don't end up having to spend the entire weekend in my apartment. But, who knows, if I did have to, perhaps I'd start catching up on all the things I've been meaning to complete, and start one or two of those projects I've had shelved for far too long now.

At the very least, you can probably expect this to be the first of many posts this weekend.
