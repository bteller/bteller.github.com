title: Old Code

Does anyone else find it hard to get yourself to delete old code?

I'm looking around inside of my Subversion repositories, having recently installed the AnkhSVN extension for Visual Studio 2010, and I have a lot of crap, and I do mean crap, out here. Who knows that I was thinking. I guess it's time to warm up the delete key and get rid of some of these old, very much dead, projects.
