title: Apparent Death to Not-So-Smart Phones?
---

Being true to my previous post I stopped by the T-Mobile store after work today to look at some not so smart phones. For starters, I hated the selection they had. All of the phones seemed cheap, like they would be very easily broken. That wasn't what got me though. I started talking to one of the sales reps in there about their phone selection, and my reasons for potentially abandoning my android phone for something less feature packed, and he indicated that the trend in the market suggests that within the next few years most carriers will no longer sell your traditional cell phone. I guess for consumers that means we can expect to pay more for the phone itself going forward, and substantially more for the service.

In retaliation I went home and tried to simply downgrade my existing mobile service, only to read something I didn't see before, which is that a change in my contract appears to require a 2-year extension. Who do these people really think they are?
