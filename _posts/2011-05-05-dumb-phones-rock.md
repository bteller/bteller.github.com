Yeah, I said it. That is my opinion so far at least. I've had the new phone for just about two weeks now, and I'm really digging being that unplugged. While the last phone was a complete piece of crap, it was still receiving updates and popping up alerts from Facebook, Twitter and then all the Google services I use. I'll tell you, those dings and dongs and rings and things these smart phones do are really hard to ignore. I was constantly shifting my attention from that which mattered to the phone, just to see what all the fuss was about. It wasn't ever worth it, no exceptions. So, I'm free of all that noise, which has made me more productive at work, and more relaxed to boot.

I do have one complaint though, the noises this thing makes are loud and obnoxious. The good thing is, it hardly ever makes them. The occasional text message, which isn't much since most everything goes through my Google Voice account, and the even less occasional phone call, and that's it.

So, when are you going to do it? Don't you want to save money, be more productive, and more relaxed? It's cool to be low-tech!
