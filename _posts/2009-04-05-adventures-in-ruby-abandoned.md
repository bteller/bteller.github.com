I have, for the time being at least, abandoned my adventures in Ruby, as well as RoR.

Most of the applications I write are web-based, so therefore I spent most of my time learning the Ruby programming language while trying to get an RoR application to behave in the manner I have grown accustom while coding an ASP.Net application in C#. The difference between these web frameworks, for me at least, is night and day. ASP.Net is a very mature framework, and developing applications on this framework is very intuitive. You can start with classes previously defined in your .Net application, whether it was a console application or class library, and build on those until you have built a site that meets your needs. The beauty of this is tht you can then take the code you wrote for that, and very easily port your web application into a windows forms application. If you separated out your code properly you likely even had a data access layer and business logic layer separate from your presentation layer, so porting the application from the web to windows forms is as simple as writing a new presentation layer. With Ruby and RoR the approach is entirely different.

While the Ruby language itself is quite elegant, when you try and fit that into the number one web framework for it, RoR, it starts to lose its appeal to me. Perhaps in a few years RoR will mature a little more, and we'll see concepts like reusable controls, but for me it just isn't there yet. I actually spent a few hours searching the web today for any indication that RoR provided similar functionality, but the only promise I saw was in plug-ins and helpers. Apparently the concept of controls was completely abandoned.
