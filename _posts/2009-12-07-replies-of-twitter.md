First, I'm finding myself up annoyingly late once again... but that isn't the reason for this post.

Does anyone else out there wish Twitter would do away with allowing replies to your tweets?  I can't help but think there are more appropriate services to use when you desire collaboration on something you share, say Facebook or Google Wave.

I wish I could disable them.  I've seen some posts on how to disable @replies, but they seem to be geared towards disabling the previous generation, and are not relevant to the current Twitter offering.  If anyone knows of a way to do this, please share.  If there isn't currently a way, I'm hoping Twitter hears my plea and offers one in the future.
