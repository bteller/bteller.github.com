I'm sorry but things are a mess right now. I decided to cancel my hosting plan with the provider I was using because I was only using it for this blog, for which I couldn't justify paying $15+ a month. So, I'm transitioning back over to Blogger where I started. Unfortunately I didn't save off some of the images from my old posts before I killed my access to the hosting location and I don't have a backup. So, over the course of the next few days or so I'll be cleaning things back up, recovering or replacing what I can.
