I had meant to write about this a few months ago when I made the switch back to a smart phone, but, well, I just didn't. Anyway, after having survived a while without a smart phone and then having bought an iPod Touch to have around the house in lieu of buying a laptop computer I decided to move back to a smart phone. The truth of the matter is that I still do not use my phone very much, not having a keyboard was a real pain. I think in the end my little experiment of ditching the smart phone was an utter failure, and at the end of the day I believe it probably cost me more money than it saved me. I've had buyers remorse ever since getting the new phone, which is an HTC Evo 3D running on Sprint's 4G network, and I'm not really thrilled about having an $85 per month bill for the service, but I just can't bring myself to do without it.

Some of the pros anyway:

- I don't have to buy a new GPS, the phone has a decent GPS with maps that always update.
- Now I don't have to suffer through responding to my friends text messages.
- It has come in handy when I've found myself waiting on someone or something for an extended period of time, so I can use it as an eBook reader or surf the web.
